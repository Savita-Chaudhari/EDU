In the contemporary educational landscape, feedback mechanisms are pivotal for enhancing
 student learning experiences and academic performance. This paper presents a novel approach
 to feedback collection through the utilization of Quick Response (QR) codes, which are two
dimensional barcodes capable of storing information. The proposed QR code-based feedback
 system for students offers an efficient and convenient method for gathering feedback from
 students in educational settings. The system involves the creation of unique QR codes linked to
 specific feedback forms or surveys. These QR codes can be easily generated and distributed
 across various educational materials, such as lecture slides, assignments, or classroom posters.
 Students can use their smartphones or other QR code scanning devices to access the feedback
 forms by scanning the QR codes. Furthermore, the QR code- based feedback system offers
 advantages such as anonymity and confidentiality, encouraging students to provide honest and
 constructive feedback without fear of judgment. Additionally, the system facilitates the
 automation of feedback aggregation and analysis, streamlining the feedback review  process for
 educators and administrators.
